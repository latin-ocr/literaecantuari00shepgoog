Ol the simplest kind erc those where a well-todo
founder established an altar in the aisle of his own
village church (Bocking‚ Ickbam), and endowed it with
sn estete yielding an income sufficient sor the support
of one priesh who was bound to perform certain re·
ligious offices on behalf of the founder and his nominees.

More stately in form, but similar in kind and object,
were those chantries which the Arehbishops Arundel,
(lhicheley, Bourchier‚ and Warbem endowed in their
cathedrsl church; in each of which ceses chaplains were
appointed to perform the daily offiees at an altar near
the sumptuous tornb of the founder for whose spiritual
benefit the offices were recited. Another kind ¹of chentry
is indicated in the indented deeds by which the Chapter of
Canterbury pledge themselves to provide commemorative
norwicen, for Archbishop Courtenay at Ommrbury, and
Dr. Ohendler at Oxfordin gratitude for benefite already
voluntarily conferred on them, without stipulation for
this or any other kind of repayment The annun ccle-
brations by which the Chapter requited the favour of
King Richard ΙΙ. who relieved them from the burthen
of “ corrodies'' were of the same class as those laet
mentioned.

On the principle that “tres faciunt collegium,'' those
foundations which consisted of more than two members
were named collepes, but where that number was not
reached they were described ss chantries. The colleges
renged in importence from the little rural establishment
at Brsdgar, where one priest presided over two scholare
or socii, who were eligible for admission tc their office
at seven years of age, to the great corporations et Maid-
stone and St Michael’s, London. The former of these had
provision for twenty-four members, and the latter con-
sisted of four priests (of whom the rector of the parish

Ἕω the chief) and a proportionale number of clerks and
c oristers.
