INTRODUCTION.

'lun documenta comprised in the third volume oi
Litcrce Contootono cover the space of about a hundred
and fifty years, during which period the history of the
monks flowed smoothly 0n; the convene received uo
remarkable benefactions, nor was it subjected to any
great persecutione. It is true thatin 1381 an Archbiahop
oi Centerbury was murdered3 but, except in tho few
lines by which the vacancy is noted in the Sede Vacante
register‚ the records of the Gathedral do not notice the
event. The fact is, that the blameless Sudbury was
a purely political victim-that it was as (lhaneellor and
not as Arohbishop that he incurred the· vengeance oi

during this century and ahalf twelve Priors in saccea

thatin most cases their names would be unknown, were
it not that, iu the registers, the Cancellarii have duly

of the ldth century the hitoroe celebrate the results of
Prior Chillenden’e love of building; and towards the end
Prior Sellyng appears as an active promotor of a concor·

there is no act recorded which could render illustrioue
any of the Johns and Williarns whose names appear, at
the headings oi the letters, diguified by the title of
Prior Eccleoioe Christi cantuariense„ possibly this
