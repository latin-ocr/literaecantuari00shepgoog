μ sayde direccions aa by the same aunsuer yowr Hyghnes may
wel peroeyve, yf yt might lyke the same at a convenient lesur
to peruse and rede it. How be it my sayde adversaries, per-
oeyyyng yowr Gracc to be so greatly busied with this yowr
Grocels) interprese that sor lak ol lesur yowr Grace can nothir
redo yt nor yet hyere my sayde annswer, have surmised my
sayde aunsuer to be colerable, ond that I shnlde use excuses ond
delaym, whoys parciall reportes and sinistre informacions ayenst
me yn that behalfe shulde nowe sone appere evidently to yowr
Graco, ys my sayde fer-mor aunsuer mought be well seen herd
and considered. Wharsor trustyng in the grente gondoenus, in·
different equite, and singular wisedom of yowr noble Gracc,
1 moost humble beseche yowr Grace to ronchessfe at yowr best
, lesure to take the paine to have the hirynge and trewe re·
lacion of the contente ol my fyrst consuet, wheruppon l trust
yower Gracc, of yowr moost noble and indifferent equitayoll
yndge the same aunsuer to be reasonable, and myne adversaryes
to be more importune, in suyng to yowr Grace for yowr so oft
wrytynge to me yn this motior, than¹ reson or juste cause
requirythe; and yf they can shewo any thynge conteyned in
any parte of tho sayde former annsner made to yowr Grace to
be contrarye to reason, lewe, or good conscience, both my sayd
brothren the Prior and his Oonvent and also 1 monght be
resonably put and dryven to a lerther annswer.

And wher os myne adversaryes have informed yowr Gracc (as
it apperith yn yowr Grecos sayde lettres), that Ι use delayes
yn my sayde aunswcr; yowr Hyghtnes not offendet, he that
offerith hym selfo, as Ι do yn my fyrst annover, to do al maner
things at the commendement of yowr‘ Gracc, which Ι may do
(not doyng contrarye to the solem othe that Ι have made to my
Ohurohe for the maintenaunoe and continual dafenes of the
ryghts libertyes and privileges of the same, nor losyng the
possession that my sayde ‘Ohnrohe hath had and enjoyed this
three hundred yeres and moro) yn myne opinion naith no
delaye, but playnly offerith hym selfe to do ss moche and as
farre as he may, withowte the offence of God, and jubardy of
conscience. And Iso not what lsrger offers my sayde adver-
saryes can os reason require ol me then be conteyned as wel yn
my sayde fyrst answer as yn this, except they wolde have me to
consent to peryurys‚ and to the loslsle of the ryght of my
(lhurch03 sor, by the same my fyrst answer, Iofferred my solie to
be agreable to al thynges conteyned yn yowr sayde direccion,
thst Ι may consent unto sovyng myself from peryury, and
savyng the longe contynned right of my Ohurohe. Itrust
