At the end of the alth century, and for some time
after, it was held theta stipeud of about ten marks,
with a dwelling-housc free os rent, was sufficient for
the maintenance of achantry priest. Thus at Bocking
the ehaplain was passing rich with an income of seven
pounds and a house standing in a rood of ground. The
third chentry priest at Maidstone was endowed with
exactly ten marks, and, without doubt, roonis in the
college. Again, although the priests of the Black Prince’s
Ohantry in the crypt of the cathedra] had, between thern,
an income of twenty pounds and a dwelling iu common,
in their special case this sum was not found sufficient
for their support, in consequence, probably, of the greater

thern the opportunity “ to make it as good as they kan.''
At Bredgar Collega the income and the expensas were
so nicely balanced, that the founder foresaw a difficulty
in finding money ιο pay for any extraordinary outlay
which might be required for repairing the buildings,
and he therefore, in his ordinatio, arranged that when
the Collega became dilapidated, the Mentor might sing

the case of the Beheebourne chentry the income had in
1363 fallen as low as aix marka, farther diminished by
the eost of a pair of epure, which the priest was bound
to present yearly to the founders heire. Aa this small
