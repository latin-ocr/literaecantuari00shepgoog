commendanti assentpussed over sea to rescue the land of Gas-
cony, which was on the point of being lost by your treacherous
advice, you seutover sea a great sum ofmoney to certain evil men ·
your accomplices, in order to ruin Our Lady, und her son who
is the right heir to the kingdom, and to prevent their return
home to this land; and es if this had not been enough for their
injury end ruin, γοα compelled, Hugh, your father and Bobert
de Baldock aud other fulse treitorr, your accomplices, to do the
seme thing, and so you went about by see andland all through
the kingdom assuming royal state, compelling all men, both
great end small, to swear, and to ottech themselves to you, to
maintain γοα in your false charges against all manner of people,
not regardi ng that such proceedin gs were disloyal and treasoneble,
aud opposed to your allegiance, and to the dignity of the King
aud of his crown; and whoever refused you, ογ your sovereign
power, γοα caused them to be thrust into miserable dungeone,
as happened to Sir Henry ds Beaumout aud others, who would
not swear to you, nor assent to your evil doings. And then
when you, Hugh, and the other false traitors who were your
accomplices, knew that Madame and her son had come to land,
by your evil counsel, γοα induced the King to avoid them, and
you led him out of his kingdom (to the great risk of his person
eud to the great dishonour of him and of his people), taking
with you the national treasure und the King's great seal.
'l'hus Hugh es you heve been proved to be a traitcr, therefore
all the good men of tho realm, both great and smull, both rich
and poor, and by common assent, condemn you Hugh, so that
as you have been found guilty as a thief therefore you shall be
hanged; end as you have been found guilty as a traitor therefore
γοα shall be drawn and quurtered, and your quarters dispersetl
through the kingdom; and as you were outlawed, by our Lord
the King and by general consent, and heve come beck to the
Oourt, therefore you shall be beheaded; end because at all times
you have been disloyal and a fomenter of strife between our
Lord the King aud our most noble Lady the Queen and othere
of the realm therefore γοα shall be disembowelled, and after that
your bouels shall be burned Confess yourself a traitor end a
renegade! and so go to meet your doom, Treitorl Ilvildoerll
und Convicted ! 11
