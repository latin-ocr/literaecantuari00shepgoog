Christ Church, together with a competent space οἳ
ground for erecting a monor-house (od Curium nostram
fordradum), and 60 acres of land; both being probably
provided for the dwelling and sostenance of the rector.

This demise seems to have been soon forgotten;
apparently, as much by the lessee aa bytho lessors, fcr
the former took no steps towards assuming possession,
and it was not until the beginning of the next century,
