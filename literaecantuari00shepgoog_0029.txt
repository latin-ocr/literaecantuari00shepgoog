xviii israonuenou,

session beginning on the sixth ol June bad explained the
King's intentione and asked ior a subsidy:

“ . a . Pro the whioh twentieth day ol January, this present
Psrlisment, by dyvers prorogatione, hath be contynued unte
the sixth dayes June tbe fonrteenth yere ol* yowrs noble
reign: atta which day and sithen, by the mouth oi yowre
Chauncellor ol Engloud, it hsth be opened and shewedto us
youra said Comens in this present Parliament, that your-e
knyghtly corage entended, and entendith, to bold the said ringo

rpiall &pposito owns roisll persone, in as goodly hast as shsn
psas .”

Here again it appears that the person who made the
appeal to the Parliament for the grant was the Chanoellor
oi England, audibat in the granting of the application
the Commoris used the same forms ol words as are found
ia the speech which is copied in the Canterbur'y registar.
It may, therefore, be safely concluded that this speech⁴
isan authentia transcriptos that which the Chaneellor
pronounced on the sinth oi ,J une 1474 3 nor is there any
difficulty in explaining the occurrence of a copy st
Canterbury. The Chaucellor was Thomas Rotberham,
first, Bishop oi Rochester, theu, and at the time when the
speech was made, Bishop of Lincoln, and finally, Anub—
bishop of York. He appears, from the registers of Christ
Cburch, to have been a legal adviser ol the Convent for
many years before be became a Bishop‚ and in 1466,
nine years before he delivered the oration in question,
the Chapter shewed their appreciation oi his merita by
electing him, together with Alice Rotherbam his mother,
to full confraternity with their society. Hence as an
ex-counsel of the Monastery, as Bishop ol the adjoinin'g‘

diocese which was always intimately associated with -

that of Canterbury, and as an adopted brother of tho
Chapter, it may readily be believed that the Clrancellor
was apersonal friend oi the Prior, to whom he was
likely to presente copy of his greod speech, even pos·
sibly his own drait; which the Prior would be laudably

proud to enrol in his register.
