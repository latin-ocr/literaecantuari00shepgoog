themselves enemies oi the King our aeid Lord, were, on
the tenth day of April in the year 14031ast past, cap· -
tured, in the manner of wer, by some ships belonging to
this place. Of which fact informatione and proper
declaratione were lately made by our command, to the
end and intention that said men of Prussia might be
saved from the endnring and suffering of any injustiee
or undue hardship, as will appear to you by a roll ap·
pendant to these presente, under our own eeal and also
under the seals of the Staple of England established

we send to you, in order to give you to understand
plainly and certainly all the process of the said lact, in
exoneration of us and oi those above named. To which
we pray you to give, aiter due deliberation, attention and
regard3 and in all the above mentioned things soto

so, the truth oi what wil] be done herein. And the
Holy Spirit have you in his bleesed keeping. Written,
