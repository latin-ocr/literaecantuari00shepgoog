Edward, dte. To our dear aud leyal cousin Sir Thomas Earl
of concessor, greeting. Very dear cousin, we have, as well you
know, in this our coming parliament to debete and discuss
divers and great matters touching the etate of our land of Scot-
land‚ and to devise some relies against our Scottish enomies, who
from dayto day perpetrate homicides, robberiee‚ fine-raisings,
and all manner of other ills that they can against us, not only in
our said land of Seotland but in our own land of England3 on
which subject it behoves us to have counsel and advice both
from the prelatas and from the other nobles of our resim. And
we have heard that certain persons intend to insult our honour-
able Father-in-God the Archbiehop of canterbury (to whose
counsel and advice we especially trust in these matters) as he
comesto our said parliament‚ upon pretext of the disputa which
there is between him and the (said) Archbishop of York in the
matter ol the displaying of their crosses, for the happening of
which thing we have great dread, seeing that he is coming by our
command audior the common profit. Also we understand that
the other prelatos of the province of Cantarbury, his suffragans,
hesitate to come there if that so happen (which God forbid) to
the great disturbando and hindrsnce of our above said affairs,
and to the heavy damage of us and our realm. Now, whereas
we desire with our whole heaut the successful accompliehment of
our said affaire, vve specislly pray you, very dear Cenem, as our ο ⁷
trust is in you, that γοα will, for love ol ne, be pleaeed to receive
the said Arehbishop ol (lanterbury into your company, and salely
conduct him to us in our said parliament at York, so that no
injury, molestation‚ or insuit, may be done to him, or to hie
eroes, or to any of hie train, by which the said affairs may be
hindered. And this duty be pleasod to undertake, having it at
beart as you love us, so that we may be able to feel the thorough
good will which you have for us and sor the eompletion of our
said affairs. And certify us speedily by your letters, and by the
bearer ol these, what you propose to do in this matter. Given
bc, the fourth day of September in the eight year ol our

reign.
