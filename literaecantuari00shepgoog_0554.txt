[110100. 800. Prior 102. each Volume or Part]

00 25 July 1822, the Hense of (1οι0οι000 presented en address to the (irown,
stating that the editions of the werke ofour ancient historiens were inconvenient
and defective ; that many of their writings still remained in manuscript, and, in
some ceassiu a single 00 y only. They added, ‘⁶ that 00 uniform and 000-
“ venient edition of the 011010, published under His Majesty’s royal sanction,
⁴‘ would be en undertaking hononrable to His Majesty's reign, and conducite 10
“ 110 eduensement of historical and constitutional knowledgee that the House
‘⁴ therefore humbly besought His Majesty, that He would be graciously pleased
“ to give such <lineatione as His Mayesty, in His wisdom, might think flt, for
‘⁸ the publication of a complete edition of the ancient historiens of this resim,
‘⁸ and assured His Majesty that whatever expense might be necessary for this
‘⁸ se would be made good.''

he Mester of the Rolls, being rery desiroue that effect should be giren to the
resolution of the House of Gemmeus, submitted to Her Ma'esty’s 'lheasury in
1857 splen for the publication of the ancient chroniclss and memoriale of the
United Kingdom, end it was adopted accordingly. In selecting these works, it
was considered right, in the first instance, to gire preference to those of which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materiale of which would help to fill up
blanks in English history for which no satisfactory end authentio informetion
hitherto existed in any eocessible form. One great object the Master of the Belle
had in view was to form a eorpus 1101001000 within reasonable limite, and which
should be as complete es possible. Ine subject of so raet 0 range, it was im.
portant that the historioel student should be able to select such volumen as
conformed with his own peculier testesand studies, aud not be put to the expense
of purchasingthe whole collecticn; an inconvenience insepareble from any other
plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.
