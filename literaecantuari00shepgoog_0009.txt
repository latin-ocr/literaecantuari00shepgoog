'lhe works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished; the whole responsibih'ty of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be ehoseu by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty's rreum, after a eareful
consideration ol tho subject, expressed their opinion ina
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the aeeomplishment of this important
national object, in an effeetual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention he
paid to eoouomy, in making the detailed arrangements‚
without unueoessary expense.'’

They expressed their approbation oi the proposal that
eeoh Ohroniole aud historieul document should he edited
in suoh a manner as to represent with allpossibleoorreot
ness the tert of eaoh writer, derived from a collutiou of
the best Mes, and that no notes should be added, exeept
suoh as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the prefaee to eaeh work should
ooutuiu, in addition to the particulars proposed hy the
Martenoi the Itolls, a biographioal eeoount of the author,
so far as authentia materiale existed for that purpose,
and en estimato oi his historioal eredibility and velue.
