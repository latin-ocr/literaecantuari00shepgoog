DURING llll} llIDDhll laus,

On the aoth ol J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal ior the publication
oi materials for the History of this Oountry from the
invasion of the Romans to the reign ot Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were most scerce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historiam docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps; and
for this pmpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collationes the best Mas,

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the Mas, employed by him, oi their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the worlxa
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology ; but
no other note or comment was to he allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text.
