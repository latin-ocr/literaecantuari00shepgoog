it may be gethered, that the writer considered that it
was almost in consequence oi supernatural intervention
that ιιι translationes the relies was deferred in spite
of previous attempta to effect it, until e period oi
eraetly fifty years was interposed between it and the
martyrdom, and he supporta his opinion by reasons
extracted from ιιι Old Testament, expressed with much
enthusiasm, bnt wanting in clearness.

No information remains concoming any celebretion ol
ιιι festivals from 1220 to 1370 ; and from the silence of the
recorda it may be inferred that the perdono were granted
as matters of course. As on these occasions there was
no controversy, so no documento are to ιι found
rolating ιο ιιι subject. Wharton, in the Anglia Sacra, Δ. s„ 1.
quotes a narrative, which tells how Simon Sudhury, ⁴⁹·
then Bishop ol London‚ incurred unpopularity by dis·
coumging pilgrims who were on their wey ιο ιιι cele·
bration oi 1370 ; warning them not ιο trust ιο ιιι

of the festival is to be found in the registers oi the
Monsstery.

Τιι dubilsc ol 1420, according to an entry in a con·
tempor-ary record belonging ιο ιιι Oity of Oanterbnry,

lodged and sed without any increase in the ordinary
price of provisions. In this year the oblatione at the
shrine amounted ιο more then six hundred pounds, say,
in modern currency, at least eight thousand pounds.

In preparation for the festival of 1470, Tiptoit Earl of
Worcester, solicited the Pope in 1454, and two of the
most eminent of the Ounterbury monks were dispatehcd
to Rome, carryinga petition to Popc Paul ΙΙ, who, ap·
parently, conceded the usual privileges without difficulty;
end this was the luet occasion upon which tho Jubilee
was celebrated
