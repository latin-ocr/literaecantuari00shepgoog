when the founder was a Bishop, and still living, his
name was inserted io the Collect. “Repe quaeamus
“ famulam laeam prcesaleea nostram M. N, etc.;'’
which was erchanged aster his death for: “ Deae qai
“ later apostolicos sacerdotes famulam larua M. N.
“ ireeffabili la dispositione connumerari volamli, etc.'’
The one collect, however, which was invariably em-
ployed, in place of or in addition to the others, was that

the Chapter to retain the monor as the endowment of a
chentry, bnt in the commemorative collects of the daily
inesses the original founder's name was erased aad that
