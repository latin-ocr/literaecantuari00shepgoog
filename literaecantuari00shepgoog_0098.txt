shrine oi the glorious Martyr St. Thomas; and we heve
most excollent cause, in view of what hos happened
to us, both we and you, to thanlr for it the High Sove·
reign Worker of Miraoles, who has deigned to work
this miraole in our days, and upon a foreigner, as though

bound to praise him and to offer for it gratitude and
thanks, which we accordingly desire to do hy his grace
with all our power and unieignedly; praying you espe-
cially that, for your part, you will equally do the same,
to the honour ol him from whom spring all profit and
honour, and for a good example to all your dependente.
And verily, very dear cousin, we have a very complete
hope, that in our and your time our noble and holy pre·
decessore will be more glorified than they have been l'or
a long tirne; and the probable oeuse which moves usto

this opinion ie this ε that in our days, that is to say in
the present day, our saith and belief have many more

the merey of J esus Christ and by the exhibition of these
miracles, will be, as we believe, converted from their

errore to the way of salvation3 which may God hy his
high power fulfil, to his glory, and to the glory of all
saintsand the salvation of ull his people. Very decr
