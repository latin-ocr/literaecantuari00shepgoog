The letters dated in 1520, written by Dr. Grig, the

Advocate 10 the Ourie 01 the Archbiahop und 01 the
Monestery, show that the extravagant demands mede in
that year by Pope Leo X. 01 perticipation in the prufits
01 the impending festival caused its extincticn, since the
Archbishop and the Chapter declined to appropriate one
hell 01 the gross receipts 10 the building 01 St Peter’s,
although they were williog, or rather although they
offered, to sunender the same proportion 01 the net
profits after their neoessary expenees hed been deducted.
As the registers contain 00 reference tc any actual cele-
hration 01 this festival, it may be concludcd thet neither
Rome or Canterbury made the required concessione, and
that therefore 00 celebration took place. At the next
recen-ing period 01 fifty years, in 1570, Jubilees, the
the llonastery 01 Christ Ohurch, and the cultus 01 St.
'lhomus in the Oethedral, had all 1000100 matters 01
ancient history.
