by the nobles who rebelled against Henry IV, in the
first year of his reign, his story is clear und distinct3
but farther on when, trusting to the nbility ol his
correspondent to read between the lines, he writes aa
it were in cypher, he becomes unintelligible to modern
readers. It is more than probahle 'that the Archbishop
exaggerated the guilt oi his nephew, whom he charges
with attempted sacrilege and quasi-parricide; for in
going, as he says he did, from Oroydon to the King at
Windsor, ho would pass Kingston‚ which at the time
was in possession of the rebel forces, in which casa
his danger would have been great enough, without
the additional treachery of an ambuscade especially
contrived, as the writer insinuates, by the Earl oi
Kent to entrap him. 'Phe circumstances by which
the Arehbishop was endangered were shortly these.
The Earls oi Huntingdon, Kent, and Salisbury, parti-
aana of the dethroned Richard‚ invited the King to
a tournament at Oxford on ard January, intending
to treasonably assassinate him; but he, being'warned,
fled from Windsor to London, where his party was pre-
dominant, whereupon the conspiratora on the next day,
sch danuam, made a dash at Windsor Oastle, which
they captured. On this same day the Archbishop,
believing that the King was still at Windsor, set out
from his palace at Croydon to join him, and on the way

, approaohed Kingston·on·Thames, where he had pre-

pared to pass the night, but finding the place in the
hands of rebel soldiers he turned aside and escaped
without being recognized. ln all this, and whatever
else the letter contains, there is nothing except the
Archbishop's denunciation of the “ parricide '’ to con-
nect the Earl of Kent with the occurrence; nor does it
appear that he had any notice of his uncle’s journey.
The uncle’s savage rejoieing over the Earss's death at
Oirenoester would lead one to think that there was no

more love on the sida of the uncle than the latter aaaerts
